# Day of Date web app 
It was implemented using bootstrap framework and JavaScript. It is based on the doomsday algorithm without the help of any code resources or databases, just the basic understanding of the algorithm. It takes any date from the user either in past or in the future and returns which day of the week it is exactly. It is also a PWA which means it can be downloaded as a mobile app and be used entirely without the internet.

It is fully functional and deployed on Netlify.
